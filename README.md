# pyfit
fitness cli app

todo: 
[] make basic layout for different options
[] figure out how to make the script run over and over again so you can sit within the app the whole 09:11
[] read and write data to a file


So how I think this is gonna go is I am gonna just have the user (me) run the script when ready to use, and then at the end I'll ask the user if they are done, if not, I'll see if the program can just rerun itself, and if yes, then it'll end.
